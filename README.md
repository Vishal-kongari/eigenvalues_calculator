# eigenvalues_calculator
In this project, I have implemented core matrix operations using the C programming language. My focus is on calculating the eigenvalues of a given matrix, performing LU decomposition for matrix factorization, computing the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, and determining the matrix's determinant. These operations are fundamental in numerical analysis, scientific computing, and various engineering applications. By leveraging the efficiency of C, the project aims to provide a robust solution for handling these mathematical computations.
#Learning Outcomes
Array Operations: We deepened our understanding of how to efficiently perform arithmetic operations on arrays, as well as how to effectively pass arrays to functions. This enabled us to handle matrix data seamlessly within our program.

Understanding Modular Programming: We learned the principles of modular programming, which helped us break down complex problems into manageable components. This approach not only simplified our code but also improved its readability, maintainability, and scalability.

Exploration of Advanced Mathematical Algorithms: Beyond the core objectives, we explored potential extensions such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), QR decomposition, and the calculation of matrix rank. This broadened our perspective on mathematical problem-solving and opened up future opportunities for enhancement.
